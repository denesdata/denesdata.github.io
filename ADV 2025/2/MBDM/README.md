# Vega-Lite Bar Chart Example

This is a simple example of a standard bar chart created with Vega-Lite.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a basic bar chart visualization using Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. The chart displays categorical data with bars representing values for each category.

## Features

- Clean, responsive design
- Interactive tooltips on hover
- Export functionality for the chart
- Sample data included

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No installation is required. You just need a modern web browser.

### Running the Project

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser

Alternatively, you can use a local development server:

```bash
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server

# If you have Node.js installed
npx serve
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` or the URL provided by your server.

## Customizing the Chart

To modify the chart:

1. Edit the data in `chart.js` to change the values or categories
2. Adjust the Vega-Lite specification in `chart.js` to change colors, dimensions, or other visual properties
3. Modify `styles.css` to change the page layout and styling
